# Project 4 Prediction of energy consumption and emissions.
Prediction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in non residential buildings in Seattle

# First step is in Projet 4 Nettoyage.
This is a step of explorative data analysis, and data cleaning. We create a set of dataframe to perform multiple regression models to predict both the electricity consumption and green house gas emissions of non-residential buildings in Seattle.

# Second step is in Projet 4 Analysis.
This is the actual analysis/ regression building. Modern regression models are tested to select the best estimator for the quantities studied.

Next is determining the usefullness of ENERGYSTARScore, and wether or not we should keep it.
